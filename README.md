## 1. ML capstone project Overview <a name="Overview"></a> 

- The Bank Problem:

Getting a loan from the Social Development Bank requires some
conditions because many conditions are difficult to extract loans,
and this does not support our vision 2030 so we found a solution to
this problem.

- How can Data Science help solve this problem ?

Data Science has become very important in the Finance Industry,
which is mostly used for Better Risk Management and Risk Analysis.
Better analysis leads to better decisions which lead to an increase
in profit for financial institutions. Companies also analyze the
trends in data through business intelligence tools.

- Solution:

Reducing the number of conditions to facilitate access to loans,
opening projects, and facilitating other things

- How our solution will drive business impact ?

Analyzing the trends in data through Data Science. Detection the
featurees and minimize them will improve the use of data. Also,
reduce time and work consumed.

## 2. Data Review <a name="DataReview"></a>


The dataset includes the data of the clients
financed by the bank.

It's has 15 columns and 11,175 records.

Only three columns were used in the project.



## 3. Data Pre-processing <a name="data"></a> 

1. Handling missing values
2. Handling Outliners
3. Features Engineering (One-hot , Label encoding)



## 4. The Roadmap to Build ML Model<a name="Models"></a> 

- Data
- Data Manipulation
- Features Engineering
- PCA
- Testing multiple models
- Grid search
- Pipeline
- Save a model



## 5. Results<a name="Results"></a> 
##### In our project, we focused to follow the below:

First, analyzed the dataset of (Saudi Arabia Social Development Bank
Loans 2019) for detection of the features which minimizing them will
improve the use of data and reduce time and work consumed.

For this purpose:

applied  EDA, Features Engineering, PCA and Regressions Models .

Second, developed a model by building three different models (Linear
Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest) and comparing the
performance of each model and choosing the best one which is
(Random Forest) to complete the operations on it.
For this purpose:

- Found the results of (R2, MAE, MSE, SQRT) for each one of these three models.
- Used grid search to determine the best hyperparameters.
- Also, did a comparison between the models before and after the pipeline.

Third, Graphical User Interface (GUI) has been done by Power BI, using
two dashboards to show the information for the dataset by displaying
all components in a simple way and easy for understanding.

Finally, have identified several tasks for better analysis that leads to
better decisions which lead to an increase in profit for financial
institutions.
